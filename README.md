# gifParadise

This is a page created for Week 6 of the UW Coding Bootcamp. Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, and Javascript were used as well as the Giphy API.

Predetermined  collection of buttons should be visible, and on click should display 10 different gifs. On click of a single gif, it should animate, click again and it will stop the animation.
